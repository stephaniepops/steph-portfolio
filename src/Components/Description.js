      Hello! I'm Steph. Currently I am in my last year of Applied Computer
      Science at the University of Winnipeg. Outside of school I enjoy exploring
      new technologies to help me become a more well-rounded programmer.
      Eventually I hope this portfolio will host many exciting projects. Enjoy{" "}
